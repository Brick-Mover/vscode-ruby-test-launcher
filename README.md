# vscode-ruby-test-launcher README

This extension leverages the test_launcher gem to make it easier to run your ruby tests from vscode.

## Features

You can run a single test, all tests in the current file, and rerun the previously run test.

runTestLine - cmd+shift+r
runTestFile - cmd+alt+r
rerunLastTest - cmd+r

## Requirements

This extension requires that you have the "test_launcher" gem installed. See https://github.com/petekinnecom/test_launcher

## Release Notes

All releases are experimental at this point as I test things in the marketplace.
